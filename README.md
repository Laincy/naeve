> _Naeve_ is pre-alpha quality and is undergoing large changes. I'd avoid using it at the until a release to avoid losing your notes. This README only serves as a lodestar at the moment, rather than a description of implemented features.

_Naeve_ is an offline-first app for managing a knowledge base. It aims to provide a simple, stable, and extensible base that can be morphed into whatever the user needs it to be. Planned features include vim motions, a tag based file system, and a plugin system.
